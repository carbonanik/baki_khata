Here are some features that would add significant value to a Bangladeshi small shop (Baki Khata) app, ranging from essential to premium:

# 🚀 High Impact (Essential)
## SMS / WhatsApp Reminders
Feature: A button on the Customer Details page to send a pre-filled message (e.g., "Dear Customer, your total due at [Shop Name] is ৳500. Please pay soon.").
Why: This is the #1 way to recover debts faster. Integrating with WhatsApp is free and very popular.
## PDF Reports & Invoices
Feature: Generate a PDF receipt for a specific sale or a "Due Statement" for a date range to share with customers.
Why: Adds professionalism and provides a physical or digital record for disputes.
## Data Backup & Restore (Google Drive)
Feature: Save the database file to the user's Google Drive.
Why: Critical. If the phone is lost or broken, the shopkeeper loses all their financial records.
# 📊 Business Intelligence
## Dashboard & Analytics
Feature: A chart on the home page showing "Daily Sales vs. Collections" or "Top 5 Customers with Highest Due".
Why: Helps the shop owner understand cash flow at a glance.
## Expense Tracking (Khoroch Khata)
Feature: A separate tab to log shop expenses (Rent, Electricity, Tea/Snacks).
Why: "Baki Khata" tracks income/due, but real profit calculation needs expense tracking too.
# 🛠 Utility & UX
## Bangla Language Support (Localization)
Feature: A toggle to switch the entire app interface to Bangla.
Why: Many small shop owners might be more comfortable with a fully Bangla interface.
## Search & Filtering
Feature: Filter customers by "High Due" (e.g., > ৳1000) or sort by "Last Transaction Date".
## Product Inventory (Stock)
(I see you might be exploring this with product_repository.dart)
Feature: Track stock quantities (e.g., "Rice: 10kg left"). Warn when stock is low.
Which of these sounds most interesting to you? I can help you plan and implement any of them.
